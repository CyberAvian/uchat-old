# UChat

A chat application created by CyberAvian. 

## About

UChat began as a project to learn React and Express, but has now been shifted to a long-term project. The goal is to create a functional chat application for use with friends and family. Depending on how I feel, I may expand this project to be a full-featured chat application for anyone to use.
